One of the most aggressive, destructive, and lethal diseases, brain tumors (BTs) reduce patients' average life expectancy. Patients with BTs have a lower likelihood of survival when they receive inadequate medical care and a misdiagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used for tumor analysis. However, the volume of data generated by MRI makes it challenging to manually segment images in a reasonable amount of time, which restricts the use of established standards in clinical practice. Therefore, effective and automatic segmentation methods are needed. In biomedical imaging, the precise early detection and segmentation of BTs is a complex and challenging issue. The high temporal and structural diversity of brain tumors makes automated segmentation problematic. Therefore, early detection and treatment are crucial.

Various conventional machine learning (ML) techniques have been used to find brain tumors or malignancies. The manual feature extraction in these models is the main challenge, though. The above-mentioned issues are resolved by this research's deep hybrid learning (DeepTumorNetwork) model of binary BTs categorization. The suggested approach replaces the five layers of GogLeNet with fourteen layers of a CNN model that automatically extracts features, creating a hybrid of the two architectures. The proposed model's major performance indicator was compared against Hybrid models (CNN+Bidirectional GRU and CNN+XGBoost). On a major performance metric (Acc, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score) of BTs categorization, the proposed technique also performed better than average.
